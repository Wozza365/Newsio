## About this project
A server-client project designed to take advantage of a web API to enhance the client application.
The server is written in Python and the client in C# Forms.

The application is a simple game with components that are chosen based on which topics are in the news. 
The server scans for keywords on a search with the Webhose API.
The game mode, map and characters are then selected based on these results.

This was prior to me picking up C#/Node.js for server side applications and JavaScript client applications.
